# first-app-vue
things I learned from my first vue js applications are : 
    1.instance 
    2.methods (we can access the datas using this keyword)
    3.v-bind (directives : to use data in method )
    4.v-text
    5.v-html
    6.conditional rendering (v-if ,v-else)
    7.v-show (always render to dom but if condition does not match then it will not show )
    8. v-for (used in array , objects)
    9.v-update
    10.event (on click)
